# MicroInverse_paper

This repository includes code for reproducing results in Nummelin et al (2018). 

Note that because the code evolved during the project there might be more efficient ways to carry out certain tasks. Therefore the intention of this repository is to provide an example, but for your own project I would recommend taking a critical look at the code and updating it when possible.
